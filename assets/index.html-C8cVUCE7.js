Excellent for learning, experimentation, and sharing machine learning code. While not a &quot;production&quot; platform like Vertex AI, it&#39;s extremely popular for its ease of use and free access to compute resources (though with limitations).</li><li><strong>Gemini:</strong> Google&#39;s large language model (LLM), positioned as a competitor to OpenAI&#39;s GPT models. Gemini&#39;s capabilities are integrated into various Google products and services, and are also accessible through APIs. Different versions of Gemini (e.g., Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra) offer varying levels of capability and access. It powers several consumer-facing features across Google&#39;s ecosystem.</li><li><strong>AI Studio</strong> Cloud-based machine learning platform offered by several companies, most notably Google with its Google AI Studio (now largely integrated into Vertex AI) and Amazon with Amazon SageMaker Studio. While both share the general goal of providing a user-friendly environment for building, training, and deploying machine learning models, their specific features and offerings differ. https://aistudio.google.com/</li></ul><h3 id="vertex-ai" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vertex-ai"><span>Vertex AI</span></a></h3><p>This is the central hub for most Google Cloud&#39;s AI/ML services.
