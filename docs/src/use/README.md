## Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering involves the design and creation of prompts that are used to elicit specific responses or actions from AI models or interactive systems. These prompts are carefully crafted to guide the behavior or generate particular outputs from the AI, such as generating natural language responses, providing recommendations, or completing specific tasks.

### Definition

In the context of AI language models, prompt engineering is especially important for shaping the model's behavior and output. By designing prompts effectively, engineers can influence the model's responses and ensure that it generates coherent, relevant, and accurate content.

There are four main areas to consider when writing an effective prompt. You donâ€™t need to use all four, but using a few will help!

- `Persona`: Who is the user you're writing for? What are their skills and knowledge?
- `Task`: What specific action do you want the user to perform?
- `Context`: What information does the user need to know to complete the task?
- `Format`: What is the desired output of the task?

**Example Prompt:**

* [`Persona`] You are a Google Cloud program manager. 
* [`Task`] Draft an executive summary email
* [`Context`] to [person description] based on [details about relevant program docs]. 
* [`Format`] Limit to bullet points.

### Advice & feedback
By using "act as," you are establishing a specific context for the language model and guiding it to understand the type of task or request you are making. This helps to set the right expectations and provides the language model with the necessary context to generate a response tailored to the defined role.

```
"Act as a creative writing assistant and generate a short story based 
on a prompt about a futuristic world where robots have become sentient."
```

### Summarize
```
Help me write an article of this document [Insert or copy paste document text]
Generate 5 titles out of the following topicâ€¦.
Generate a subtitle to catch readersâ€™ attention on the following topic [describe the topic]
```

### Fix 
```
Help me find mistakes in my code [insert your code]
Explain what this snippet of code does [insert code snippet]
What it the correct syntax for a [statement or function] in [programming language]
How do I fix the following programming language code [program language] code which explain the functioning [Insert code snippet]
```

### Write
```
Create a template of an email response to customer inquiring about â€¦.
Create a guide that explains how to use â€¦.
Write step by step instructions
```

## Presets
The `presets` feature in our app is a powerful tool that allows users to save and load predefined settings for their conversations. Users can import and export these presets as JSON files, set a default preset, and share them with others on Discord.

## Preformatted prompts 

The prompts feature in our app is a powerful tool that allows users to save and load predefined prompts for their conversations.
You can use a prompt with the /[`prompt command`]. A prompt can have parameters, which are replaced with values when the prompt is used.

Prompts  creation is available at the right sidebar. You can create a new prompt, edit an existing prompt, or delete a prompt.

**Exemple of preformatted prompts : Explain the following code snippet in Java, Kotlin or Javascript**

* Click on the `+` button to add a new prompt.
* name your prompt : `explain`
* on Text tab, you can write your prompt :
```
Explain the following {{language:Java|Kotlin|Javascript}} snippet of code: 
{{code}}
```
![preformatted_prompts_config](../assets/images/prompt.png)

* Now you can use the `/explain` command to get the explanation of the code snippet.
