**Exemple of preformatted prompts : Explain the following code snippet in Java, Kotlin or Javascript**

* Click on the `+` button to add a new prompt.
* name your prompt : `explain`
* on Text tab, you can write your prompt :
```
Explain the following {{language:Java|Kotlin|Javascript}} snippet of code: 
{{code}}

## AI providers 

### Azure OpenAI
Azure AI Search (formerly known as "Azure Cognitive Search") provides secure information retrieval at scale over user-owned content in traditional and generative AI search applications.

Information retrieval is foundational to any app that surfaces text and vectors. Common scenarios include catalog or document search, data exploration, and increasingly feeding query results to prompts based on your proprietary grounding data for conversational and copilot search. When you create a search service, you work with the following capabilities:

* A search engine for vector search and full text and hybrid search over a search index
* Rich indexing with integrated data chunking and vectorization (preview), lexical analysis for text, and optional applied AI for content extraction and transformation
* Rich query syntax for vector queries, text search, hybrid queries, fuzzy search, autocomplete, geo-search and others
* Azure scale, security, and reach
* Azure integration at the data layer, machine learning layer, Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI

### Google
Google Programmable Search Engine (formerly known as Google Custom Search and Google Co-op) is a platform provided by Google that allows web developers to feature specialized information in web searches, refine and categorize queries and create customized search engines, based on Google Search

### Anthropic
Claude is an Artificial Intelligence, trained by Anthropic. Claude can process large amounts of information, brainstorm ideas, generate text and code, help you understand subjects, coach you through difficult situations, help simplify your busywork so you can focus on what matters most, and so much more.

## Assistants 
The Assistants API enables the creation of AI assistants, offering functionalities like code interpreter, knowledge retrieval of files, and function execution. The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and files to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, File Search, and Function calling.

### Azure Assistant

## Plugins
The plugins endpoint opens the door to prompting LLMs in new ways other than traditional input/output prompting.

::: warning 
Every additional plugin selected will increase your token usage as there are detailed instructions the LLM needs for each one
For best use, be selective with plugins per message and narrow your requests as much as possible
